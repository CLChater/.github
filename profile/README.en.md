## 🌐 Overview

**Simi** is a next-generation **decentralized and secure communication & social platform**.  
We aim to create a network that operates **without central servers** and **without storing chat records**,  
allowing every user to communicate, collaborate, and grow freely — with complete privacy and control.

- 🧩 **Controlled Community System** — Private groups, encrypted circles, and tiered community management  
- 🪄 **Secure Collaboration & Content Retention** — Productivity and privacy, combined in one environment  
- ⚙️ **Fully Self-Developed Architecture** — IM engine, security protocols, and data management built independently
